# Portfolio Optimization  
This Repository is designated for Portfolio Optimizations such as traditional Mean-Variance Optimization and Black-Litterman Model via quadratic programming (QP).

Markowitz's Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO) model provides a mechanism for the selection of portfolios of securities (or asset classes) in a manner that trades off the expected returns and the risk of potential portfolios.

Black-Litterman Model is an asset allocation model that was developed by Fischer Black and Robert Litterman of Goldman Sachs. The model encompasses an investor's view with the market equilibrium.
